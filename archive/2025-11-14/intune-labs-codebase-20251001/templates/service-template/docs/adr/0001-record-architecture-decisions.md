# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We commit to documenting architectural decisions to ensure traceability across services.

## Decision
Every material architecture change will include an ADR committed alongside the code change, referencing requirements and trade-offs.

## Consequences
- Enables future teams to understand why decisions were made.
- Requires discipline to keep ADR log current.
